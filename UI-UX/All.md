## 1. **User FLow**

Make a user flow diagram.

## 2. **Wireframe**

Each step in the user flow diagram corresponds to a page or screen. The different screens are designed as wire frames.

The following resources can be used to design wireframes:  

1. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
2. [Freehand](https://www.freehandapp.com/)
3. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

## 3. **Design System**

Here we create with the visuals of design. These are the guidelines for the reusable components and variables like the designs for the UI elements such as <mark>buttons</mark>, <mark>inputs</mark>, <mark>radio</mark>, etc.

We also set a color pallet and fonts for the design here.

Another thing we define here are the icons and logos to be used in the design.

Having a strict design pattern helps maintain the consistency in the project.

### Colours

The pallet colours should be as comprehensible as possible, including the:

+ Background
+ Text
+ Primary
+ Secondary
+ Accent
+ Error
+ Success

These can have different variations.

To make a color pallet [Realtime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com) can be used.

### Fonts

The fonts should be as readable and capture the tone of the product. 

Again [Realtime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com) combined with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) can be used to experiment with different fonts within a real website.

The second useful tool is [Typescale](https://typescale.com/), where we get a good ratio and sizes for these fonts.

### Icons

There are different types of icons like: 

1. Flat
2. Skeuomorphic
3. Glyph
4. Dual Tone
5. 3-D
6. Outlined
7. ...

Just stay true to one type.

[Freehand](https://www.freehandapp.com/) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) can be user for icons.

### Other UI elements

These are like buttons, forms, inputs, and everything the project needs.

## 4. **Design Principles**

**Visual Hierarchy**: To show the order of importance.

**Contrast**: Helps distinguish elements and make them readable.

**Balance**: Moderate the spacing, alignment and placement.

**Consistency**: Keeps elements harmonical.

**Simplicity**: Keeps things clear.

**Feedback**: Keeps keeps users engaged.

## 5. **Illustrations**

This optional and purely aesthetic. These can be used:

## **Inspirations**

1. **[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/)**
2. **[Behance](https://www.behance.net/)**
